mapReduce idea comes from the concept of language lisp's concept: map and reduce, what are them?

map : [Function]

      map result-type function sequence &rest more-sequences

      The function must take as many arguments as there are sequences provided; at least one sequence must be provided.
      The result of map is a sequence such that element j is the result of applying function to element j of each of the
      argument sequences. The result sequence is as long as the shortest of the input sequences.

      it kind like java lambda expression map.I guess java also learn from this too.
reduce: [Function]

        reduce function sequence &key :from-end :start :end :initial-value

        The reduce function combines all the elements of a sequence using a binary operation; for example, using + one
        can add up all the elements.

        it just like some assemble operation in java stream.I guess also learn from this.
